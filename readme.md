# Paper Rock Scissors for Command-line 📃🗿✂️

## About

* * *

Rock paper scissors (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock"
sometimes being called "stone", roshambo or ro-sham-bo) is a hand game usually
played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three
shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper"
(a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger
extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also
indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of
being held upright in the air.

Bassicly the it's a simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes.

Firstly the users should set up a project build directory before
compiling:
